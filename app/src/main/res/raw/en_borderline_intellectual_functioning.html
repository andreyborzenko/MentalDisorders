<h1>Borderline intellectual functioning</h1>
<p><b>Borderline intellectual functioning</b>, also called <b>borderline mental disability</b>, is a categorization of intelligence wherein a person has below average cognitive ability (generally an IQ of 70&#x2013;85), but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (below 70). It is sometimes called <b>below average IQ</b> (BAIQ). This is technically a cognitive impairment; however, this group may not be sufficiently mentally disabled to be eligible for specialized services. Additionally, the DSM-IV-TR codes borderline intellectual functioning as V62.89, which is generally not a billable code, unlike the codes for mental disabilities.</p>
<p>During school years, individuals with borderline intellectual functioning are often &quot;slow learners.&quot; Although a large percentage of this group fails to complete high school and can often achieve only a low socioeconomic status, most adults in this group blend in with the rest of the population.</p>
