<h1>Fugue state</h1>


<p><b>Dissociative fugue</b>, formerly <b>fugue state</b> or <b>psychogenic fugue</b>, is a dissociative disorder. It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality. The state is usually short-lived (ranging from hours to days), but can last months or longer. Dissociative fugue usually involves unplanned travel or wandering, and is sometimes accompanied by the establishment of a new identity. It is a facet of dissociative amnesia, according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).</p>
<p>After recovery from fugue, previous memories usually return intact. Because of this, there is not normally any treatment necessary for people who have been in fugue states. Additionally, an episode of fugue is not characterized as attributable to a psychiatric disorder if it can be related to the ingestion of psychotropic substances, to physical trauma, to a general medical condition, or to other psychiatric conditions such as dissociative identity disorder, delirium, or dementia. Fugues are usually precipitated by a stressful episode, and upon recovery there may be amnesia for the original stressor (dissociative amnesia).</p>




<p>Symptoms of a dissociative fugue include mild confusion, and once the fugue ends, possible depression, grief, shame and discomfort. People have also experienced a post-fugue anger.</p>

<p>A doctor may suspect dissociative fugue when people seem confused about their identity or are puzzled about their past or when confrontations challenge their new identity or absence of one. The doctor carefully reviews symptoms and does a physical examination to exclude physical disorders that may contribute to or cause memory loss. A psychological examination is also done.</p>
<p>Sometimes dissociative fugue cannot be diagnosed until people abruptly return to their pre-fugue identity and are distressed to find themselves in unfamiliar circumstances. The diagnosis is usually made retroactively when a doctor reviews the history and collects information that documents the circumstances before people left home, the travel itself, and the establishment of an alternative life.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Definition">Definition</span></h3>
<p>The cause of the fugue state is related to dissociative amnesia, (<i>DSM-IV Codes 300.12</i>) which has several other subtypes: selective amnesia, generalised amnesia, continuous amnesia, and systematised amnesia, in addition to the subtype <i>dissociative fugue</i>.</p>
<p>Unlike retrograde amnesia (which is popularly referred to simply as &quot;amnesia&quot;, the state where someone forgets events before brain damage), dissociative amnesia is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, <i>DSM-IV Codes 291.1 &amp; 292.83</i>) or a neurological or other general medical condition (e.g., amnestic disorder due to a head trauma, <i>DSM-IV Codes 294.0</i>). It is a complex neuropsychological process.</p>
<p>As the person experiencing a dissociative fugue may have recently suffered the reappearance of an event or person representing an earlier life trauma, the emergence of an armoring or defensive personality seems to be for some, a logical apprehension of the situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the terminology <i>fugue state</i> may carry a slight linguistic distinction from <i>dissociative fugue</i>, the former implying a greater degree of <i>motion</i>. For the purposes of this article then, a <i>fugue state</i> occurs while one is <i>acting out</i> a <i>dissociative fugue</i>.</p>
<p>The DSM-IV defines as:</p>
<ul>
<li>sudden, unexpected travel away from home or one&apos;s customary place of work, with inability to recall one&apos;s past</li>
<li>confusion about personal identity, or the assumption of a new identity</li>
<li>significant distress or impairment</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Merck Manual</i> defines <i>dissociative fugue</i> as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>One or more episodes of amnesia in which the inability to recall some or all of one&apos;s past and either the loss of one&apos;s identity or the formation of a new identity occur with sudden, unexpected, purposeful travel away from home.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In support of this definition, the <i>Merck Manual</i> further defines dissociative amnesia as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>An inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by normal forgetfulness.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The DSM-IV-TR states that the fugue may have a duration from hours to months, and recovery is usually rapid. However, some cases may be refractory. An individual usually has only one episode.</p>
