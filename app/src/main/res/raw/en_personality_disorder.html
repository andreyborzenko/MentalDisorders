<h1>Personality disorder</h1>

<p><b>Personality disorders</b> (<b>PD</b>) are a class of mental disorders characterized by enduring maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, exhibited across many contexts and deviating markedly from those accepted by the individual&apos;s culture. These patterns develop early, are inflexible, and are associated with significant distress or disability. The definitions may vary somewhat, according to source.</p>
<p>Official criteria for diagnosing personality disorders are listed in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> (DSM), and in the mental and behavioral disorders section of the <i>International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems</i> (ICD), published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM-5 lists personality disorders in the same way as other mental disorders, rather than on a separate &apos;axis&apos;, as previously.</p>
<p>Personality, defined psychologically, is the set of enduring behavioral and mental traits that distinguish between individual humans. Hence, personality disorders are defined by experiences and behaviors that differ from societal norms and expectations. Those diagnosed with a personality disorder may experience difficulties in cognition, emotiveness, interpersonal functioning, or impulse control. In general, personality disorders are diagnosed in 40&#x2013;60% of psychiatric patients, making them the most frequent of psychiatric diagnosis.</p>
<p>Personality disorders are characterized by an enduring collection of behavioral patterns often associated with considerable personal, social, and occupational disruption. Personality disorders are also inflexible and pervasive across many situations, largely due to the fact that such behavior may be ego-syntonic (i.e. the patterns are consistent with the ego integrity of the individual) and are therefore perceived to be appropriate for that individual. This behavior can result in maladaptive coping skills, may lead to personal problems that induce extreme anxiety, distress, or depression. These patterns of behavior typically are recognized in adolescence and the beginning of adulthood and, in some unusual instances, childhood.</p>
<p>Many issues occur with classifying a personality disorder. There are many categories of definition, some mild and some extreme. Because the theory and diagnosis of personality disorders occur within prevailing cultural expectations, their validity is contested by some experts on the basis of inevitable subjectivity. They argue that the theory and diagnosis of personality disorders are based strictly on social, or even sociopolitical and economic considerations.</p>


<p>The two major systems of classification, the ICD by the WHO and DSM by the American Psychiatric Association, have deliberately merged their diagnoses to some extent, but some differences remain. For example, ICD-10 does not include narcissistic personality disorder as a distinct category, while DSM-5 does not include enduring personality change after catastrophic experience or after psychiatric illness. ICD-10 classifies the DSM-5 schizotypal personality disorder as a form of schizophrenia rather than as a personality disorder. There are accepted diagnostic issues and controversies with regard to distinguishing particular personality disorder categories from each other.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="General_criteria">General criteria</span></h3>
<p>Both diagnostic systems provide a definition and six criteria for a <i><b>General Personality Disorder</b></i>. These criteria should be met by all personality disorder cases before a more specific diagnosis can be made.</p>
<p>The ICD-10 lists these general guideline criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markedly disharmonious attitudes and behavior, generally involving several areas of functioning; e.g. affectivity, arousal, impulse control, ways of perceiving and thinking, and style of relating to others;</li>
<li>The abnormal behavior pattern is enduring, of long standing, and not limited to episodes of mental illness;</li>
<li>The abnormal behavior pattern is pervasive and clearly maladaptive to a broad range of personal and social situations;</li>
<li>The above manifestations always appear during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood;</li>
<li>The disorder leads to considerable personal distress but this may only become apparent late in its course;</li>
<li>The disorder is usually, but not invariably, associated with significant problems in occupational and social performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ICD adds: &quot;For different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules and obligations.&quot;</p>
<p>In DSM-5, any personality disorder diagnosis must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual&#x2019;s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events).</li>
<li>Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response).</li>
<li>Interpersonal functioning.</li>
<li>Impulse control.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The enduring pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The enduring pattern is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., head trauma).</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_ICD-10">In ICD-10</span></h3>
<p>Chapter V in the ICD-10 contains the mental and behavioral disorders and includes categories of personality disorder and enduring personality changes. They are defined as ingrained patterns indicated by inflexible and disabling responses that significantly differ from how the average person in the culture perceives, thinks, and feels, particularly in relating to others.</p>
<p>The specific personality disorders are: paranoid, schizoid, dissocial, emotionally unstable (borderline type and impulsive type), histrionic, anankastic, anxious (avoidant) and dependent.</p>
<p>Besides the ten specific PD, there are the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Other specific personality disorders</i> (involves PD characterized as eccentric, <i>haltlose</i>, immature, narcissistic, passive-aggressive, or psychoneurotic.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Personality disorder, unspecified</i> (includes &quot;character neurosis&quot; and &quot;pathological personality&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Mixed and other personality disorders</i> (defined as conditions that are often troublesome but do not demonstrate the specific pattern of symptoms in the named disorders).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Enduring personality changes, not attributable to brain damage and disease</i> (this is for conditions that seem to arise in adults without a diagnosis of personality disorder, following catastrophic or prolonged stress or other psychiatric illness).</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="In_ICD-11">In ICD-11</span></h4>
<p>In the proposed revision of ICD-11, all discrete personality disorder diagnoses will be removed and replaced by the single diagnosis &quot;personality disorder&quot;. Instead, there will be specifiers called &quot;prominent personality traits&quot; and the possibility to classifiy degrees of severity ranging from &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, and &quot;severe&quot; based on the dysfunction in interpersonal relationships and everyday life of the patient.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="In_DSM-5">In DSM-5</span></h3>
<p>The most recent fifth edition of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> stresses that a personality disorder is an enduring and inflexible pattern of long duration that leads to significant distress or impairment and is not due to use of substances or another medical condition.</p>
<p>DSM-5 lists ten specific personality disorders: Paranoid, Schizoid, Schizotypal, Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic, Avoidant, Dependent and Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.</p>
<p>The DSM-5 also contains three diagnoses for personality patterns that do not match these ten disorders, but nevertheless exhibit characteristics of a personality disorder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personality change due to another medical condition &#x2013; a personality disturbance due to the direct effects of a medical condition.</li>
<li>Other specified personality disorder &#x2013; general criteria for a personality disorder are met but fails to meet the criteria for a specific disorder, with the reason given.</li>
<li>Unspecified personality disorder &#x2013; general criteria for a personality disorder are met but the personality disorder is not included in the DSM-5 classification.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Personality_clusters">Personality clusters</span></h4>
<p>The specific personality disorders are grouped into the following three clusters based on descriptive similarities:</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cluster_A_.28odd_or_eccentric_disorders.29">Cluster A (odd or eccentric disorders)</span></h4>

<p>Cluster A personality disorders are often associated with schizophrenia: in particular, schizotypal personality disorder shares some of its hallmark symptoms, e.g., acute discomfort in close relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and eccentricities of behavior, with schizophrenia. However, people diagnosed with odd-eccentric personality disorders tend to have a greater grasp on reality than do those diagnosed with schizophrenia. Patients suffering from these disorders can be paranoid and have difficulty being understood by others, as they typically have odd or eccentric modes of speaking and an unwillingness and inability to form and maintain close relationships. Though their perceptions may be unusual, it is important to distinguish these anomalies from delusions or hallucinations as people suffering from these would be diagnosed with other conditions. There is significant evidence that suggests that a small proportion of people with Type A personality disorders, especially schizotypal personality disorder, have the potential to develop schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. These disorders also have a higher probability of occurring among individuals whose first-degree relatives have either schizophrenia or a Cluster A personality disorder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paranoid personality disorder: characterized by a pattern of irrational suspicion and mistrust of others, interpreting motivations as malevolent.</li>
<li>Schizoid personality disorder: lack of interest and detachment from social relationships, apathy, and restricted emotional expression.</li>
<li>Schizotypal personality disorder: a pattern of extreme discomfort interacting socially, and distorted cognitions and perceptions.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cluster_B_.28dramatic.2C_emotional_or_erratic_disorders.29">Cluster B (dramatic, emotional or erratic disorders)</span></h4>


<ul>
<li>Antisocial personality disorder: a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, lack of empathy, bloated self-image, manipulative and impulsive behavior.</li>
<li>Borderline personality disorder: pervasive pattern of abrupt mood swings, instability in relationships, self-image, identity, behavior and affect, often leading to self-harm and impulsivity.</li>
<li>Histrionic personality disorder: pervasive pattern of attention-seeking behavior and excessive emotions.</li>
<li>Narcissistic personality disorder: a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cluster_C_.28anxious_or_fearful_disorders.29">Cluster C (anxious or fearful disorders)</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Avoidant personality disorder: pervasive feelings of social inhibition and inadequacy, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation.</li>
<li>Dependent personality disorder: pervasive psychological need to be cared for by other people.</li>
<li>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder: characterized by rigid conformity to rules, perfectionism, and control to the point of satisfaction and exclusion of leisurely activities and friendships (not the same as and quite different from obsessive-compulsive disorder).</li>
</ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_personality_types">Other personality types</span></h3>
<p>Some types of personality disorder were in previous versions of the diagnostic manuals but have been deleted. Examples include sadistic personality disorder (a pervasive pattern of cruel, demeaning, and aggressive behavior) and self-defeating personality disorder or masochistic personality disorder (characterised by behaviour consequently undermining the person&apos;s pleasure and goals). They were listed in the DSM-III-R appendix as &quot;Proposed diagnostic categories needing further study&quot; without specific criteria. The psychologist Theodore Millon and others consider some relegated diagnoses to be equally valid disorders, and may also propose other personality disorders or subtypes, including mixtures of aspects of different categories of the officially accepted diagnoses.</p>
