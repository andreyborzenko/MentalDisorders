<b>Persecutory delusions</b> are a set of delusional conditions in which the affected person believes they are being persecuted. Specifically, they have been defined as containing two central elements:<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The individual thinks that harm is occurring, or is going to occur.</li>
<li>The individual thinks that the perceived persecutor has the intention to cause harm.</li>
</ol>
According to the DSM-IV-TR, persecutory delusions are the most common form of delusions in paranoid schizophrenia, where the person believes "he or she is being tormented, followed, tricked, spied on, or ridiculed." They are also often seen in schizoaffective disorder and, as recognized by DSM-IV-TR, constitute the cardinal feature of the persecutory subtype of delusional disorder, by far the most common. Delusions of persecution may also appear in manic and mixed episodes of bipolar disease and in severe depressive episodes with psychotic features, particularly when associated with bipolar illness.<p></p>
